# GorenScripts

## The cool and radical scripts for the Goren PnP

### Overview
This is a repository collecting random scripts that can be used in the Goren Pen and Paper. The scripts may be used however you want, they have been created for this very specific purpose though.

### Download
There are two ways to get the files:
- If you just want to get the scripts themselves, you can head over to the [RELEASE PAGE](https://github.com/Syrapt0r/GorenScripts/releases).
- If you want to contribute, you can get the entire source code by running `git clone https://github.com/Syrapt0r/GorenScripts` from your command line.

### Roadmap
It's hard to create a roadmap since features will only be implemented as needed. If you have any ideas or scripts, feel free to pull request them in though.
